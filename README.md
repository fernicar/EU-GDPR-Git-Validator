# üîí EU GDPR Git Validator (TINS Edition)

**Are your Git repositories GDPR compliant?**

This tool analyzes your Git history for potential European data protection violations. This TINS Edition refactors the original command-line tool into a modern GUI application using PySide6, following the principles of TINS (There Is No Source).

## üöÄ GUI Architecture

This version of the EU GDPR Git Validator features a new GUI built with PySide6. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, with a clear separation between the business logic and the user interface.

### Key Architectural Features:

*   **PySide6-based GUI**: The entire user interface is built using PySide6, the official Python bindings for the Qt framework.
*   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: The application follows the MVC pattern to separate the data model, the user interface, and the control logic.
*   **`model.py`**: This file encapsulates the core business logic of the application, including the Git scanner, GDPR analyzer, and compliance checker.
*   **`main.py`**: This file contains the view and controller logic for the PySide6-based GUI.
*   **Signals and Slots**: The GUI communicates with the business logic using Qt's signals and slots mechanism, ensuring a decoupled and event-driven architecture.
*   **Jinja2 Templates for Reports**: The application uses Jinja2 templates to generate interactive and user-friendly HTML reports.

### GUI Components:

*   **Main Window**: A central window that provides access to all the application's features.
*   **Repository Selection**: A user-friendly interface for selecting the Git repository to be analyzed.
*   **Scan Configuration**: Options for customizing the scan, such as selecting specific GDPR articles to check.
*   **Interactive Report View**: A web view widget for displaying the HTML compliance report.
